<h2>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h2>
<p>I adapted this receipe from a book called Sydney Food by <i>Bil Granger</i>. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bil's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney.I have been after the recipe, I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the best scrambled eggs, I have ever tasted.</p>
<p>This recipe is what I call a <q>very special breakfast</q>, just look at the ingredients to see why it has to be tasted to be believed.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>The following ingredients make one serving:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of butter(10g)</li>
<li>1/3 cup of cream</li>
<li>A pinch of salt</li>
<li>Freshly miled black pepper</li>
<li>3 fresh chives(chopped)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Whisk eggs, cream and salt in a bowl.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat<i>(taking care not to burn the butter)</i>.</li>
<li>Pour egg minute into pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan(around 20 seconds).</li>
<li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs are only just done.</li>
<li>Grind a light sprinking of freshly miled pepper over the eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chves.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should only make a <b>maximum</b> of two servings per frying pan.</p>
